Module 1 Challenge: Google DeepMind: Case Study by Kanish Mohan

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Google DeepMind. Launched as DeepMind Technologies Limited originally. After the merger with Google Brain in 2023, the company is now known as Google DeepMind.  

* When was the company incorporated?

DeepMind started in 2010, with an interdisciplinary approach to building general AI systems. The research lab brought together new ideas and advances in machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, mathematics, simulation and computing infrastructure, along with new ways of organizing scientific endeavors.
DeepMind is a subsidiary of Google since 2014. The company is based in London, with research centers in Canada, France, Germany and the United States.

* Who are the founders of the company?

DeepMind was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman.
Suleyman left Google and co-founded Inflection AI, a new AI lab venture in March 2022.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Demis Hassabis and Shane Legg met at UCL's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit as postdoctoral researchers.
Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman likely connected through family or Hassabis' involvement in the London tech scene.
All the three founders shared a passion for artificial intelligence and its potential to solve complex problems. They envisioned creating an AI that could learn and adapt like the human brain.

Hassabis background as a chess prodigy, computer scientist, and neuroscientist, are the potential causes why he was fascinated by the potential of AI to mimic and surpass human intelligence. Legg's background in philosophy and artificial intelligence, might have influenced his interested in the ethical and philosophical implications of advanced AI. Suleyman's background in philosophy and social entrepreneurship might have influenced him to use AI to address real-world challenges and social issues.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

DeepMind's initial funding came from a diverse group of investors, including venture capital firms like Horizons Ventures, led by Li Ka-Shing, and Founders Fund, established by Peter Thiel. These firms provided crucial support in DeepMind's early stages alongside individual investors such as Elon Musk, Scott Banister, and Jaan Tallinn.
In 2014, Google acquired DeepMind for a reported £400 million to £650 million (roughly $525 million to $850 million).

DeepMind's primary revenue source is derived from internal contracts with other Alphabet companies, like Google and Verily, where it applies its AI technology to various projects. They also generate revenue through collaborations with external partners, such as healthcare institutions, by developing AI-powered solutions. While DeepMind has explored commercializing its technology through tools like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, this area is currently focused on wider accessibility and research impact, with potential for future commercialization efforts.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

DeepMind is a team of scientists, engineers, ethicists and more, working to build the next generation of AI systems safely and responsibly. They focus on solving complex problems in various fields such as healthcare, scientific discovery, climate change and gaming.  
Major scientific discovery including drug discovery, protein folding, materials science:
DeepMind’s AlphaFold AI program revolutionized protein structure prediction by achieving unprecedented accuracy. Traditionally, determining protein structures was a slow and expensive process. AlphaFold can predict structures with near-atomic accuracy, opening doors for drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and understanding protein function.
Their GNoME AI model predicts the properties of new materials, accelerating the discovery of materials with desired properties for applications like electronics, batteries, and solar cells. GNoME can identify potential materials that humans might not even think of, leading to new possibilities in material science.

Solving problems in healthcare such as medical image analysis, disease prediction, language understanding for healthcare applications
DeepMind is investigating how the brain works by building AI models that mimic its structure and function. This could lead to better understanding of brain diseases and development of new treatments.

For climate change they are modeling and understanding complex environmental systems:
DeepMind’s GraphCast AI model is able to make medium-range weather forecasts with unprecedented accuracy. GraphCast predicts weather conditions up to 10 days in advance more accurately and much faster than the industry gold-standard weather simulation system – the High Resolution Forecast (HRES), produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). GraphCast can also offer earlier warnings of extreme weather events. It can predict the tracks of cyclones with great accuracy further into the future, identifies atmospheric rivers associated with flood risk, and predicts the onset of extreme temperatures. This ability has the potential to save lives through greater preparedness.

For complex gameing, they are developing AI agents that can learn and play complex games at a superhuman level. Google DeepMind has created neural network models that learn how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as Neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), resulting in a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.

By solving some of the hardest scientific and engineering challenges of our time, they’re working to create breakthrough technologies that could advance science, transform work, serve diverse communities — and improve billions of people’s lives.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

DeepMind primarily collaborates with research institutions, healthcare organizations, and non-profit groups to apply their AI solutions to various challenges. They don't directly sell products or services to individual consumers.
